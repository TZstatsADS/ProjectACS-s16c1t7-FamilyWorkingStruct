## Load all libraries
```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
```

## Read in data(Only for parameters we are interested in)
Parameters:
MAR    Marital status
ST     State Code
PINCP  Total person's income(signed)

```{r}
reRead = 1
if(reRead == 1){
  colsToKeep = c("MAR", "ST", "PINCP", "ADJINC", "SCHL", "ESR")
  popDataA = fread("/Users/yutou/Data Science/Data/2013-american-community-survey/pums/ss13pusa.csv", select = colsToKeep)
}
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
